            <h1>I have been a writer and editor for a while.</h1>
            <p>My training as a journalist began when I was 17 (give or take 5 years ago), in my first semester of my undergrad 
                    education in my second-favorite American city: Seattle. My first subject was the 
                    abandoned fountain sculpture located in the heart of a community college there. The metal artwork
                    is a part of a complicated political era in the US where 
                    Japanese-American citizens were treated like enemies during the World War II. I 
                    reported on this topic for years for different local 
                    newspapers in the city, even as my reporting grew to include other issues 
                    surrounding politics, art and youth culture. Today, stories about this fountain remain 
                    some of my proudest work as a journalist. Read my latest, and most extensive to date, 
                    story on this piece of American history <a href="https://www.seattleglobalist.com/2017/02/19/anti-japanese-movement-led-development-bellevue/62732">here.</a></p>
                    
            <p>Fast forward a year after graduation, I came back to Jakarta, Indonesia and landed 
                    a role as Deputy Editor at VICE to work on English-language content coming out of 
                    the Indonesia office. In this position I wrote and edited hundreds of stories, though 
                    some of my favorites are under the theme of healthcare, women’s issues, art, and 
                    internet culture. I left the company in May 2019, having served as Coordinating Editor 
                    for VICE's Asia offices, after deciding I want to gain skillsin the tech industry.

            <p>My latest writing project was commissioned by Indonesia’s Ministry of Marine Affairs and 
                Fisheries. The project serves as a legacy document of former Minister Susi Pudjiastuti’s 
                work from 2014 to 2019. For more than three months, I researched and wrote about her 
                "controversial" work, and the many things she and her team did in five years to reform 
                Indonesia’s fisheries. This document has not been published as of October 2019.</p>
